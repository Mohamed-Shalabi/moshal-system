# flutter-vim-configs
my config files for using vim as a flutter code editor

## Notes:
- I was a dummy that I used Vundle and vim-plug together, and now I am lazy so I
  won't remove any of them.
- copy contents of files in `home_dot_files/` to your dot files.
- copy `coc-settings.json` to your `.vim` directory.
- copy files in `colors` in your `.vim/colors/` directory.
- I use default shortcuts included in vim plugins, more configuration is comming in the future.
- My custom shortcuts are listed below.
- Don't forget to run PlugInstall and PluginInstall :)

## Customized shortcuts:
- sl | silent | showing context menu
